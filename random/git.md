## [Clean Ignored Files](http://www.codeblocq.com/2016/01/Untrack-files-already-added-to-git-repository-based-on-gitignore/)

To remove files that are in your `.gitignore` but are not ignored by your repo, you can do the following: 

```bash
git rm -r --cached .
```

Which will clean out the repo, and then you can restage and commit all the files that should be tracked with

```bash
git add .
git commit -m ".gitignore fix"
```
